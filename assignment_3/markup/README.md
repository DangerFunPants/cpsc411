Application Specifications
================================================================================

The application provided implements a parser and syntax tree pretty printer for the M++ language. The parser provided impelements the language specification provided in the PDF at: http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~robin/class/411/M+/Mspec.pdf. 

================================================================================
Current Drawbacks 
================================================================================

The provided version of this applcation does not provide support for nested multiline comments as this involves quite a bit of "Hand-Hacking" ontop of the Alex files when using BNFC to generate specifications for the Lexer and Parser generators. 

================================================================================
Building the Application
================================================================================

To build the application, type the following command in the root directory of the project:

    make

Invoking the above command will execute a number of phases involved in the compilation of the application:

(1) Invoke BNFC in order to generate the Alex and Happy files.
(2) Execute the makefile generated by BNFC in order to generate the haskell source files resultant from the generated Alex and Happy files. 
(3) Invoke GHC in order to compile the resultant application and place the binary into the root directory of the project. 

================================================================================
Running the Application
================================================================================

The application (mcc) reads input files from stdin and prints the resulting syntax tree to stdout. In the case that there is an error in the input source file provided, the application will print the resulting error message to stderr. The application can be invoked on the command line using the following syntax:

    ./mcc < /path/to/input/file.m+
