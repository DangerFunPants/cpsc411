To run the context free grammar vital statistic checker
you will need the following alias:

alias CFG '/usr/local/sml/bin/sml @SMLload=/home/411/CFG/CFG-stats.sparc-solaris'

You can then call the CFG-VSC by:

CFG <filename>

The format for a context free grammar is as follows:

(a) Terminal are strings of uppercase letter such as 

     LPAR RPAR STOP ADD SUB ...
     
(b) Non terminals are lowercase strings such as 

     start expr rest factor ....

    you may also include upper case letters, numbers, and "_" so long 
    as the first character is lowercase.  Furthermore the string 
    can end with a series of "'"s or "+"s.

(c) It is assumed that the start symbol is the first 
    nonterminal whose productions are given.

(d) The productions associated with a nonterminal 
    are indicated as 
    
    <head> -> <RHS_1>
            | <RHS_2>
         ....
            | <RHS_n>.
    
    where the alternative righthand sides of the productions 
    are separated by a slash, "|", and terminated by a period.".".
(e) The RHS of a production is a sequence of terminals 
    or nonterminals separated by spaces.  For example:
    
              expr ADD expr
(f) Multi-line comments are written      /*  many comments */
    Single line comments are written     %   comment until end of line

EXAMPLE:   

An example grammar is:

==========================================

expr -> factor restfactor.
restfactor -> ADD factor restfactor
            | SUB factor restfactor
            |.     
factor -> LPAR expr RPAR
        | term restterm.
restterm -> MUL term restterm
          | DIV term restterm.
term -> SUB num
      | num.
num -> digits decdigits.
digits -> DIGIT restdigits
restdigits -> DIGIT restdigits
            |.
decdigits -> STOP digits.

==========================================


The context free grammar checker does more than get vital statistics 
it also tries to transform your grammar by removing left recursion 
and common left factors ... enjoy!
