NOTE: The M compiler will take all M-programs that is with arrays 
and datatypes.

To run the M compiler you need to set the following alias

alias M  '/usr/bin/sml @SMLload=/home/411/M/M.sparc-solaris'

or 

alias M  '/usr/bin/sml @SMLload=/home/411/M/M.x86-linux'

The M compiler can be called in the following modes:

(i) M <filename1> <filename2>

This compiles the m+, m+-, or m++ program in <filename1> and APPENDS 
the code to <filename2>, if this file does not exist it is created.  So it is 
important to realize that if it exists already you will not get the 
effect you want!

(ii) M <filename>

This compiles the m+, m+-, or m++ program in <filename> and APPENDS the 
code to the output file whose name is determined as follows:
    (a) if <filename> = <file>.m+ or <file>.m+- or <file>.m++ 
        then the output file is <file>.am
    (b) otherwise the output file is <filename>.am.  


BEWARE: the compiler has minimal error handling: I just threw it 
        together so you could see the sort of output expected.

EXAMPLES: Examples of M programs are in the directories 
          411/M+/M+tests, 411/M++/M++tests, and 411/M+-/M+-tests.

DOCUMENTS:  A description of M is in the various M??.specs notes.
            Some implementation notes are M++.notes.

          If you develop any interesting examples of M programs 
          (to test for interesting errors or to do neat things) 
          please mail them to me: I will add them to the test 
          directory.
