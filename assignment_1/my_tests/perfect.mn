/*
    This program reads in a number and outputs 1 in the case that the number 
    is a perfect number and 0 otherwise.

    A perfect number, n, is a number such that: 

            ( sum { x | x /= n and n % x == 0 } ) == n
    
    in other words, all numbers that are equal to the sum of their proper 
    divisors.
